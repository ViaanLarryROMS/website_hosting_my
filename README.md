# ◈ VIAAN THAKUR | System Architect ◈

Welcome to the official repository for my personal portfolio. I am a tech enthusiast and **Android Modder** currently in the **8th standard**. My work is centered on exploring the limits of mobile hardware and system-level software optimization.

## 🛠 Technical Focus
* **Device Specialization**: Deep focus on the **OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite** (codename: "larry").
* **ROM Porting**: Porting various environments from source, including **AxionAOSP**, **EvolutionX**, **LunarisAOSP**, and **Project-MistOS**.
* **System Operations**: Expert use of **Fastboot**, **ADB**, and custom recoveries to manage device firmware and unbrick hardware.
* **Deep Learning**: Currently studying Android dynamic partitions, virtual A/B systems, and AOSP local manifests.

## 📂 Project Structure
* `index.html`: Core structure and semantic layout.
* `style.css`: Main UI/UX styling and layout configurations.
* `animations.css`: Custom scroll-reveal and neon-glow effects.
